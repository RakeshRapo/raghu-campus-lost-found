## How It Works

### 1. User Reports Lost Item
- User fills out lost item form with email address
- Data is saved to Excel backend

### 2. Someone Finds the Item
- Finder clicks "I Found This!" button
- Modal opens asking for finder details (name, email, location, notes)
- Email validation ensures proper format

### 3. Finder Details Saved to Excel
- New API endpoint `/api/finder-details` processes the submission
- Updates the original lost item with finder information
- Creates a new found item record with complete finder details
- Both records are saved to the Excel file

### 4. Owner Notification & Contact
- Original owner receives immediate notification when item is found
- Owner can click "Contact Finder" button to send email directly
- Contact information is displayed in a user-friendly modal
- Pre-filled email template with all relevant details

### 5. Item Claim Process
- Anyone can click "This Belongs to Me!" on found items
- Claim form collects detailed ownership verification information
- Claim details are saved to Excel database with pending status
- **Email notifications are sent to both claimer and finder**
- Finder is notified of the claim and can verify ownership
- Claim status is tracked in the system

### 6. Email Notification Process
- **When item is found:** Email sent to original owner with finder details
- **When item is claimed:** Email sent to claimer confirming submission
- **When item is claimed:** Email sent to finder with claim details
- All emails use professional HTML templates with styling
- Emails are sent asynchronously to avoid blocking the application

### 7. Excel File Structure
The Excel file now contains two sheets:

**Lost Items Sheet:**
- All original fields plus `finderDetails` (JSON object)
- `dateFound` field when item is found

**Found Items Sheet:**
- All original fields plus:
  - `finderName` - Name of person who found the item
  - `finderContact` - Email address of finder
  - `finderLocation` - Where the item can be picked up
  - `finderNotes` - Additional notes from finder
  - `pickupTime` - Preferred pickup time
  - `reunionDate` - When the item was reunited
  - `claimerName` - Name of person claiming the item
  - `claimerEmail` - Email address of claimer
  - `claimDescription` - Detailed description provided by claimer
  - `claimLocation` - Where the item was lost (according to claimer)
  - `claimDate` - When the item was lost (according to claimer)
  - `claimNotes` - Additional proof provided by claimer
  - `claimStatus` - Status of the claim (pending, verified, rejected)
