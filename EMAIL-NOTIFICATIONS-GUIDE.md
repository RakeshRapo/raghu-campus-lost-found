# Email Notifications & Finder Details Guide

## üìß Email Notification System

The Campus Find the Lost Portal now includes automatic email notifications for key events. This system helps keep all parties informed about the status of their items.

### üîß Email Configuration

Before using email notifications, you need to configure your email settings:

1. **Copy the configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cp email-config.example.js email-config.js
   ```

2. **Edit `email-config.js` with your credentials:**
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
       email: {
           service: 'gmail', // or 'outlook', 'yahoo', etc.
           auth: {
               user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
               pass: 'your-app-password'
           }
       }
   };
   ```

3. **For Gmail users:**
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Use the App Password instead of your regular password

4. **Update the server configuration:**
   - Edit `server-excel.js` and update the `emailConfig` object with your credentials
   - Or set environment variables: `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`
